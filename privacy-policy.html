    <h1>LocaSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: March 6, 2025</p>
    <p>At LocaSync, we value your privacy. We collect data you provide—like addresses, photos (up to two per entry), folder names, and notes—to help you save and organize spots.</p>
    <p>We use Google Maps and Places for location services, which may collect search queries and device location (optional). Firebase may track usage for analytics, and Google Sign-In uses account info for login.</p>
    <p>We don’t share your data except with these services as needed. Edit or delete your data anytime in the app.</p>
