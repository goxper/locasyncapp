    <h1>LocaSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: March 6, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to LocaSync! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you use our app. By using LocaSync, you agree to these terms.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect data you provide to help you manage your locations. This includes addresses you enter, up to two photos per entry, folder names you create, and notes like parking tips or gate codes. If you enable location services, we may collect your device’s precise location (latitude and longitude) via Google Maps and Places. Search queries you enter are processed through Google Places. If you use Google Sign-In, we receive your Google account email and basic profile info. Firebase collects usage data like app interactions and crash reports to improve performance.</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data powers LocaSync’s features. Addresses, photos, folders, and notes are stored locally on your device to organize your spots. Location data enhances map accuracy if you choose to use it. Google Sign-In info authenticates your login. Firebase analytics help us understand usage trends and fix issues. We use this information to provide, maintain, and improve LocaSync, ensuring a seamless experience.</p>
    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We don’t sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing. Data is shared only with service providers as needed: Google Maps and Places process location and search data (see Google’s Privacy Policy), Firebase analyzes usage (see Firebase’s Privacy Policy), and Google Sign-In verifies your identity. We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</p>
    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You control your data in LocaSync. Edit or delete addresses, photos, folders, and notes anytime in the app. Location access is optional—disable it in your device settings if you don’t want it collected. You can revoke Google Sign-In access via your Google account. To request data deletion or ask questions, contact us at locasyncapp@gmail.com. We’ll respond within 30 days.</p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your data on your device, but no system is 100% secure. Photos and notes stay local unless you share them. Be cautious with sensitive info—transmission risks are yours.</p>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>LocaSync isn’t intended for children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect data from kids. If we learn of such data, we’ll delete it promptly.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy as LocaSync evolves. Check here for the latest version. Significant changes will be noted with a new “Last Updated” date.</p>
