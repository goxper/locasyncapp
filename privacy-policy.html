        <h1>LocaSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Last Updated: March 8, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to LocaSync! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you use our app, available in English, Arabic, Dutch, French, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, Urdu, Portuguese, and Turkish. By using LocaSync, you agree to these terms.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect data to help you manage your locations. As a guest user, you can use all features without signing in, and we collect addresses you enter, up to two photos per entry, folder names you create, and notes (e.g., parking tips or gate codes), stored locally on your device via UserDefaults. If you sign in with Google Sign-In, this data syncs to Firebase, and we also receive your Google account email and basic profile info. If you enable location services, we may collect your device’s precise location (latitude and longitude) via Google Maps and Places with your explicit permission. Search queries you enter are processed through Google Places. Firebase collects anonymized usage data (e.g., app interactions, crash reports) for authenticated users to improve performance, but not from guest users.</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data powers LocaSync’s features. For guest users, addresses, photos, folders, and notes are stored locally to organize your spots and remain on your device until you delete the app or clear storage; you can also export this data as a backup file stored locally, which we don’t access unless you share it with us for support. For authenticated users, this data syncs to Firebase for access across devices and is retained until you delete your account. Location data enhances map accuracy if enabled. Google Sign-In info authenticates your login. Firebase analytics help us understand usage trends and fix issues for signed-in users. We use this information to provide, maintain, and improve LocaSync, ensuring a seamless experience in your chosen language.</p>
    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We don’t sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing. Guest user data stays local unless synced. For authenticated users, data is shared only with service providers as needed: Google Maps and Places process location and search data (see Google’s Privacy Policy), Firebase stores and analyzes usage data (see Firebase’s Privacy Policy), and Google Sign-In verifies your identity. We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</p>
    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You control your data in LocaSync. Edit or delete addresses, photos, folders, and notes anytime in the app—guest data stays local, while authenticated data syncs to Firebase. Location access requires your explicit permission via a device prompt and can be revoked anytime in your device settings. Guest users can use the app fully without sharing personal info; signing in is optional for syncing. Authenticated users can revoke Google Sign-In access via their Google account or delete their account in Settings by typing 'Confirm' (if a recent login is required, you’ll need to sign in again to complete deletion), removing all Firebase data; local guest data remains unless manually cleared. Note that if we decide to shut down LocaSync or its services (e.g., Firebase backend), authenticated user data stored in Firebase could be lost—please export your data beforehand if desired. If you’re in the EU, you have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your data, and to receive a portable copy of it. California residents may request details on data shared with third parties. To exercise these rights, request data deletion, or ask questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:locasyncapp@gmail.com" class="email-link">locasyncapp@gmail.com</a>. We’ll respond within 30 days.</p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your data. Guest data is secured locally on your device via UserDefaults. Authenticated data is encrypted in transit to Firebase, but no system is 100% secure, and data could be inaccessible if we discontinue LocaSync or its backend services. Photos and notes stay local unless you share or sync them. Be cautious with sensitive info—transmission risks are yours.</p>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>LocaSync isn’t intended for children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect data from kids. If we learn of such data, we’ll delete it promptly.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy as LocaSync evolves. Check here for the latest version. Significant changes will be noted with a new “Last Updated” date.</p>
